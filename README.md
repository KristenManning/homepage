# homepage

Our app puts your weather, news, traffic/transit, to-do list and music all in one place. It's like a morning radio show on the web!

## Synopsis:

Times are changing and nowadays, many of us ignore newspapers and morning radio shows. Instead, we scroll through our Facebook or Twitter feeds and put on a podcast or pre-selected playlist when we hop in the car. Of course, social media is cluttered with fake news and distractions, and when we forgo tradtional news sources, we ending up missing important information. 

With our homepage app, we aim to get you all of the information you need, straight from the source by integrating: 

    ⋅⋅*a local weather forecast 

    ⋅⋅*NY Times top stories from a variety of topics

    ⋅⋅*travel information with real-time traffic information 

as well as music and sticky-notes for added convenience and fun! 

Our interface is designed with multiple navigation options that make it quick and simple to find the information you need.
